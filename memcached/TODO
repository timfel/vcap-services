TODO: Memcached As A Service:
----------------------------

1. Sandboxing of memcached processes when deployed on a multi-user / multi-tenant scenario
   - Currently, the memccached process runs on some port when the MaaS is provisioned (say for user u1). If
     another user (u2) has his MaaS instance provisioned on the same node, there is a likely hood that u2 might
     be able to port scan and connect to u1's memcached instance therby polluting u1's cache.

   - Possible solution: Use c-groups/warden sandboxing to isolate each MaaS instance completely

2. Varz / healtz details need to be updated to be relevant reporting parameters

3. Make other aspects of memcached configurable (such as memory/instance), add support for non-free plans.
