Cloud Foundry Service Broker enables consumption of legacy, non-CF services by CF apps using standard Cloud Foundry APIs and bindings.

== Enable service broker in vcap_dev_setup & vcap_dev

By default vcap_dev_setup will install service broker, however, vcap_dev puts
it in the excluded list. So, if we want vcap_dev to start service broker
automatically, then we should set the environment variable.

export CLOUD_FOUNDRY_EXCLUDED_COMPONENT="..."
